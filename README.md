## 📌 About This Project

This is a **console-based simulation of a Google-like account system**, built entirely using **pure Python** — no libraries, no frameworks. Just raw logic.

I made this to:
- Practice conditional logic and loops
- Handle user input and validation
- Simulate account creation, email suggestion, and login system
- Learn by building — without tutorials or copy-paste

## 🚀 What It Can Do

| Option | Feature                              |
|--------|--------------------------------------|
| 1      | Create Account (with email suggestion) |
| 2      | Login using email & password         |
| 3      | Exit the program                     |

## 🛠 Features Breakdown

- 👥 **Create Account**  
  - User enters name and surname  
  - Auto-generates email like `name+surname@gmail.com`  
  - User can accept or reject the suggestion  
  - Email must end with `@gmail.com`  
  - Password must be at least 8 characters

- 🔐 **Login System**  
  - Validates both email and password  
  - Shows success or error messages

- ⚠️ **Error Handling**  
  - Protects against non-integer input when choosing menu options

## 🧠 What I Learned

- `try-except` for error handling  
- Validating strings using `endswith()`  
- Using dictionaries with lists to store account details  
- Designing logic before writing code

## Note
- This README was crafted with the help of AI chatbots — part of my learning process, I kept it raw and honest to reflect my current journey in coding. Will refine as I grow!
